          <article className='pt-4'>
            JSON Web Token is used to create access tokens for an application. It works this way: the server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and sends it to the client.

            The client will send the token back to the server for every subsequent request, so the server knows the request comes from a particular identity. When the token is used, the receiving party verifies that the header and payload match the signature.
